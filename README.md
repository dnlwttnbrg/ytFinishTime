### Youtube Finish Time

This google Chrome Extention will add an indicator to your Youtube Video Player, that show when the Video will finish.

The time will adjust depending on your playback speed.

### Installation

Sadly I am not able right now to create an google developer account, so I cannot publish it in the google web store.

To install the Extention clone the repository. Then enter your browser Extention-Menu und enable Developer mode. Finaly import an unpacked Extention.
